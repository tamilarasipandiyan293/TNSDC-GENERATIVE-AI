					HORSE

	Introduction
		
		The horse is a domesticated, one-toed, hoofed mammal. 
		It belongs to the taxonomic family Equidae and is one
		of two extant subspecies of Equus ferus.The horse has 
		evolved over the past 45 to 55 million years from a 
		small multi-toed creature, close to Eohippus, into the
		large, single-toed animal of today. Humans began
		domesticating horses around 4000 BCE, and their 
		domestication is believed to have been widespread
		by 3000 BCE. Horses in the subspecies caballus are
		domesticated, although some domesticated populations 
		live in the wild as feral horses. These feral populations
 		are not true wild horses, which are horses that never 
		have been domesticated and historically linked to the 
		megafauna category of species. There is an extensive, 
		specialized vocabulary used to describe equine-related
		concepts, covering everything from anatomy to life stages,
		size, colors, markings, breeds, locomotion, and behavior.

	Classification
		Horses are adapted to run, allowing them to quickly escape 
		predators, and possess an excellent sense of balance and a 
		strong fight-or-flight response. Related to this need to flee 
		from predators in the wild is an unusual trait: horses are able
		to sleep both standing up and lying down, with younger horses
		tending to sleep significantly more than adults.Female horses,
		called mares, carry their young for approximately 11 months and
                a young horse, called a foal, can stand and run shortly following 
		birth. Most domesticated horses begin training under a saddle or 
		in a harness between the ages of two and four. They reach full adult
		development by age five, and have an average lifespan of between 25
		and 30 years.Horse breeds are loosely divided into three categories
		based on general temperament: spirited "hot bloods" with speed and 
		endurance; "cold bloods", such as draft horses and some ponies, 
		suitable for slow, heavy work; and "warmbloods", developed from 
		crosses between hot bloods and cold bloods, often focusing on creating
		breeds for specific riding purposes, particularly in Europe. There 
		are more than 300 breeds of horse in the world today, developed for
		many different uses.


	Lifespan and life stages
		Depending on breed, management and environment, the modern domestic
 		horse has a life expectancy of 25 to 30 years.[7] Uncommonly, a few
 		animals live into their 40s and, occasionally, beyond.[8] The oldest
 		verifiable record was "Old Billy", a 19th-century horse that lived to 
		the age of 62.In modern times, Sugar Puff, who had been listed in Guinness
		World Records as the world's oldest living pony, died in 2007 at age 56.


	Size and measurement
		The height of horses is measured at the highest point of the withers, 
		where the neck meets the back. This point is used because it is a stable
		point of the anatomy, unlike the head or neck, which move up and down in 
		relation to the body of the horse.A large brown horse is chasing a small 
		horse in a pasture.Size varies greatly among horse breeds, as with this
		full-sized horse and small pony.In English-speaking countries, the height 
		of horses is often stated in units of hands and inches: one hand is equal 
		to 4 inches (101.6 mm). The height is expressed as the number of full hands,
		followed by a point, then the number of additional inches, and ending with
		the abbreviation "h" or "hh" (for "hands high"). Thus, a horse described as
		"15.2 h" is 15 hands plus 2 inches, for a total of 62 inches (157.5 cm) in 
		height.The size of horses varies by breed, but also is influenced by nutrition.
		Light-riding horses usually range in height from 14 to 16 hands (56 to 64
 		inches, 142 to 163 cm) and can weigh from 380 to 550 kilograms (840 to 1,210 lb).
		Larger-riding horses usually start at about 15.2 hands (62 inches, 157 cm)
		and often are as tall as 17 hands (68 inches, 173 cm), weighing from 500 to
 		600 kilograms (1,100 to 1,320 lb).[26] Heavy or draft horses are usually at
 		least 16 hands (64 inches, 163 cm) high and can be as tall as 18 hands (72 inches, 
		183 cm) high. They can weigh from about 700 to 1,000 kilograms (1,540 to 2,200 lb).
		The largest horse in recorded history was probably a Shire horse named Mammoth, 
		who was born in 1848. He stood 21.2 1‚ÅÑ4 hands (86.25 inches, 219 cm) high and 
		his peak weight was estimated at 1,524 kilograms (3,360 lb). The record holder 
		for the smallest horse ever is Thumbelina, a fully mature miniature horse 
		affected by dwarfism. She was 43 centimetres; 4.1 hands (17 in) tall and 
		weighed 26 kg (57 lb)

	Genetics
		Horses have 64 chromosomes.The horse genome was sequenced in 2007. It
 		contains 2.7 billion DNA base pairs, which is larger than the dog genome,
 		but smaller than the human genome or the bovine genome. The map is available to researchers.

	Colors and markings
		Two horses in a field. The one on the left is a dark brown with a black mane
		and tail. The one on the right is a light red all over.Bay (left) and chestnut
 		(sometimes called "sorrel") are two of the most common coat colors, seen in almost all breeds.
