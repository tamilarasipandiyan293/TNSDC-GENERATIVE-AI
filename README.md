                                                 NEXT WORD PREDICTION USING RNN


                  Predicting the next word is a neural application that uses Recurrent neural networks. Since
                
         basic recurrent neural networks have a lot of flows we go for LSTM. Here we can make sure of having longer
        
         memory of what words are important with help of those three gates we saw earlier.


                  Next word prediction using RNN improves writing by suggesting the next word in messages,
                  
        emails, and essays. It uses deep learning to analyze text data, predicting the most likely word
        
        based on context. This enhances typing speed and accuracy, aiding in coherent and efficient communication.
